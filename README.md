## Hand Gesture Number Recognition

A deep learning–based computer vision system that recognizes the **number shown by a human hand gesture** and predicts the corresponding digit in real time or from images.  
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on grayscale hand gesture images to classify digits **0–9**, along with an **unknown** class.

---

### Project Overview

Hand gesture recognition plays a key role in human–computer interaction.  
This project focuses on identifying **numeric hand gestures** using deep learning and image processing techniques.

The system:
- Takes a hand gesture image as input
- Preprocesses it into grayscale format
- Uses a trained CNN model to predict the digit being shown

---

### Features

- Recognizes digits **0–9**
- Handles **unknown / invalid gestures**
- CNN-based deep learning model
- Grayscale image processing
- Batch image prediction support
- Trained model saved for reuse

---

### Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

---

### Model Architecture

- Input: **256 × 256 × 1 (Grayscale Image)**
- Convolution + MaxPooling layers
- Fully connected dense layers
- Softmax output layer with **11 classes**
  - Digits: `0–9`
  - `unknown`
